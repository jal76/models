Here are the parts in DXF format, the gun can be assembled from them. Also there are 2 3DOs with the gun assembled, just in case something is not clear with the parts. Parts may need rotating before assembly, they should not need moving though (the origins should be in right places on them).
Shield1 is the part of front shield that should move when the gun is aiming for high-trajectory (as it should do most of the time, it's a howitzer). It's better left vertical in the model and then turned to the right angle (which is 53 degrees around x-axis) in the Create() so that it could be moved with simple move shield1 to y-axis [something].
Also included are reference drawings of the gun (which I used to model it) - m30-37.tif and m30-38.tif. They are taken straight from the Russian "122 mm M-30 howitzer Mod.1938 Technical Description" which can be found at http://www.zshare.net/download/4411807fdfcca1/ (in scanned form). Drawings have no scale specified, so use the fact that wheels should be 1205 mm in diameter.
